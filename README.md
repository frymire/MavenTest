# MavenTest
Just a demonstration that I can use Maven.

If you run

	> mvn package
	
it should compile and put an executable jar in the target folder. You can run it as

	> java -jar POMTest-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
	
Or, you can double-click the jar. You won't see much for command line applications, 
but it works in this case because this is a Swing application.
